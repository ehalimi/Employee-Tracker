# Employee-Tracker

### This app helps business owners to track the information of their employees from the database. They can view, add, change, and delete the data on the employee database. It runs on the terminal with the command "node index.js" and the user is asked different questions about the actions they want to take on the database. It quits with the command "ctrl" and "c" on the terminal. The app can be used by cloning the repository to the local machine.
